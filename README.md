Petal vs sepal :
Here we use sklearns iris dataset to predict the different type of irises using the following factors
1.sepal length vs sepal width
2.petal length vs petal width

using 1 we were able to get a score of 0.9333333333333333
using 2 we were able to get a score of 0.8666666666666667

hence we can conclude that using 1 to predict would be a better option
