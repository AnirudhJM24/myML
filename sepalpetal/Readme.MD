Using the sklearn iris dataset which  consists of 3 different types of irisesâ€™ (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length, stored in a 150x4 numpy.ndarray
i designed a model using two factors
A) sepal length vs sepal width
B) petal length vs petal width
to predict the type of iris (0:Setosa,1: Versicolour,2:Virginica)
the model score for A was 0.933
the model score for B was 0.867
 A is better than B for predicting the different types of iris for this dataset
